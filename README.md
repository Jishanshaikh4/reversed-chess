# Reversed Chess
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Jishanshaikh4/reversed-chess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Jishanshaikh4/reversed-chess)
> A reverse engineered* chess implementation where the main goal is to lose; commonly known as 'Anti-chess'. Try to lose! Live playable [here (@jsfiddle.com).](https://jsfiddle.net/qLejxauc/3/). A version of this repository can also be found [here (Codepen.io/jishanshaikh4/).](https://codepen.io/jishanshaikh4/pen/zLQLQR)

## Implementation
The chessboard is implemented from chessboard.js and the main chess program is taken as it is from chess.js library. Minimal implementation is inspired from [this post (medium).](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977).

## Basis
The basis of game lies in the pseudo random number generation (*random* function in JavaScript), the chess opponent (i.e. computer/ai; the player in black play random moves in attack to player with white pieces. The concept is new, like it?
