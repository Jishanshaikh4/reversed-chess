## Implementation
The chessboard is implemented from chessboard.js and the main chess ai is implemented from chess.js library. Minimal implementation is inspired from [this post (medium).](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977).

## Basis
The basis of game lies in a pseudo random number generation (random function in JavaScript), the chess opponent (i.e. computer/ai; the player in black play random moves in attack to player with white pieces. The concept is new, like it?
